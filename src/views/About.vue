    <h3>Desperate times calls for desperate measures</h3>
    <p>Want to have a <strong> re-occuring </strong> event in yourlife? we now present <strong> MEETUP </strong> <br>
    This is an assignment from my school. We are practicing on TDD, vue and docker for this assignemnt. I have added a JSON file on jsonbin where all information is stored and new information can be pushed.
    I hope that you will enjoy this simple app and go to the faked meetings and leave an amazing review.
